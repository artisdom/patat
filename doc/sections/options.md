OPTIONS
=======

`-w`, `--watch`

:   If you provide the `--watch` flag, `patat` will watch the presentation file
    for changes and reload automatically.  This is very useful when you are
    writing the presentation.

`-f`, `--force`

:   Run the presentation even if the terminal claims it does not support ANSI
    features.

`-d`, `--dump`

:   Just dump all the slides to stdout.  This is useful for debugging.

`--version`

:   Display version information.
